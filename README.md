Introducing Big Mac üçî Burgers and Fries üçü For Mac Pro (Early 2008)

üçî This SPX Big Mac PatchToolX may also for work for Mac Pro 2009, 2010 and 2012.

Turn your Mac Pro into a Big Mac and run Big Sur on unsupported Apple branded hardware

Catalina:
If you have not upgraded your Mac Pro yet to Catalina, I recommend that you do that first. You will gain some knowledge of setting up an unsupported Mac and some this readme will make sense. For my Cat-Woman PatchTool v1.0.0 see page https://starplayrx.com/#macpro. Do not run my Cat-Woman patcher on Big Sur, it will cause an issue the legacy HFS.kext. For Dosdude1's Catalina page see http://dosdude1.com/software.html.

Disclaimer:
Before running any of these shell scripts, please back up your important data. This software is provided as is and without warranty. Good Luck. I hope this tool helps you install Big Sur on an unsupported Mac Pro.

üçü This patch tool contains Hax.dylib to assist with running the Installer from Catalina. It also contains APFS ROM Patcher for Macs that do not have the proper firmware to boot APFS volumes.

This patch tool currently does not include an SSE4 Emulator. Support for this may be added based on demand. This tool assumes you have an NVidia graphics card that supports metal. These cards include Nvidia GTX 680 2GB, 4GB, and Kepler Titan 6GB. Kepler Black Titan is currently not supported. You may be able to get it supported through MacVidCards who does an awesome job flashing non 680 cards.

PreInstall allows you to run the Big Sur beta 1 installer from Catalina:
This patcher constains a preinstall.sh that allows users to run the installer to a HFS+ disk. The installer will erase it as an APFS volume.

Using the terminal, cd to the bigmac directory.

usage

`sudo ./preinstall.sh`

IMPORTANT:
Always install with `-v`. You will want to catch the apfs_sealvolume command and turn off the power to your Mac, or if installing to external SSD, simply unplug the SSD. The apfs_sealvolume command is displayed in the console and will be 2nd line from the bottom. It comes after a reboot and will show in about 2-3 minutes after the reboot in verboe mode. Apple tries to create a sealed snapshot along with an encrypted boot disk. On a Mac Pro 3,1 and possibly other unsupported Macs, this will lead to kernel panics with CoreCrpyto. This unorthodox approach eliminates this issue. During preinstall you can add `-v` along with `-no_compat_check` to your boot args via the `preinstall.sh` tool

PostInstall patches your installation.
The post install for Mac Pro 3,1 fixes AppleHDA Audio, CD/DVD access, and Telemetry that is SSE3 compatible. If you have upgraded your WiFi and Bluetooth to 802.11ac combo card, your WiFi and BT4 should work out of the box. USB2, USB3, and USBC all work out of the box on Mac Pro with Big Sur. If you would like something added, you can contact me through https://StarPlayrX.com

This patcher contains a postinstall shell script.

Using the terminal, cd to the bigmac directory.

usage

`sudo ./postinstall.sh`



Future plans

Digital HDMI out.
Patched WiFi option for other Broadcom cards.
Mac OS Standard HFS disk mounting (This is pre HFS+)
