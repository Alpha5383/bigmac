Introducing Big Mac üçî Burgers and Fries üçü

Turn your Mac Pro into a Big Mac and run Big Sur on unsupported Apple branded hardware

Disclaimer & Catalina: If you have not upgraded your Mac Pro yet to Catalina, I recommend that you do that first. You will gain some knowledge of setting up an unsupported Mac and some this readme will make sense. Before running any of these shell scripts, please back up your important data. This software is provided as is without warranty. For my Cat-Woman PatchTool v1.0.0 see page https://starplayrx.com/#macpro. Do not run my Cat-Woman patcher on Big Sur, it will cause an issue the legacy HFS.kext. For Dosdude1's Catalina page: http://dosdude1.com/software.html.

üñ• This command line interface patcher works on a 2008 Mac Pro 3,1. Mac Pro 2009, 2010, 2012 users may also benefit from this tool.

This patch tool contains Hax.dylib to assist with running the Installer from Catalina. It also contains APFS ROM Patcher for Macs that do not have the proper firmware to boot APFS volumes.

PreInstall allows you to run the Big Sur beta 1 installer from Catalina:
This patcher constains a preinstall.sh that allows users to run the installer to a HFS+ disk. The installer will erase it as an APFS volume.

Using the terminal, cd to the bigmac directory.

usage

`sudo ./preinstall.sh`

IMPORTANT:
SSD installation is recommended and here's why. Always install with `-v`. You will want to catch the apfs_sealvolume command and turn off the power to your Mac, or if installing to external SSD, simply unplug the SSD. The apfs_sealvolume command is displayed in the console and will be add the bottom when it runs. Apple tries to create a sealed snapshot along with an encrypted boot disk. On a Mac Pro 3,1 and possibly other unsupported Macs, this can lead to kernal panics with CoreCrpyto. This unorthodox method eliminates this issue. Also use `-v`. you can add this to the boot args prompt in `sudo ./preinstall.sh`. also use `-no_compat-check`


PostInstall allows you to patch the Big Sur beta 1 installation:
The post install for Mac Pro 3,1 fixes AppleHDA Audio, CD/DVD access, and Telemetry that is SSE compatible. If you have upgraded your WiFi and Bluetooth to 802.11ac combo card, your WiFi and BT4 should work out of the box. USB2, USB3, and USBC all work out of the box on Mac Pro with Big Sur. If you would like something added, you can contact me through https://StarPlayrX.com

This patcher container a postinstall.sh

Using the terminal, cd to the bigmac directory.

usage

`sudo ./postinstall.sh`
