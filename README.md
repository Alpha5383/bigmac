Big Sur macOS 11 Mac Pro patcher 

## Bug Mac Hackathon Challenge #1 - Hot Swap USB Bug
The USB 2.0 Ports on a Mac Pro are not hot swappable for USB 2.0 input device under Big Sur 11.0.1. Same with USB 1.1 with a patch applied. The current workaround for these ports is to use a Hub. Your mission should you choose to accept, is to figure out how to get the 5 builtin USB 2.0 ports on Mac Pro 3,1 to be hot swappable for USB 2.0 keyboards, mice, and trackpads without having to use a Hub or PCIe USB 3.0 Card. The winner for this challenge gets a FREE personalized T-shirt. A Flash USB Drive with bigmac2 on it that includes your work (and credit), plus bragging rights for winning the challenge. You have permission to use the v2 branch's postinstall.sh for this mission.

## Bug Mac Hackathon Challenge #2 - Firewire 400/800 Boot Bug
Firewire 400 and 800 hard drives and SSDs are not bootable under Big Sur 11.0.1. When booting, it has a hard time seeing the drives and without -verbose boot, it gets a prohibited sign even with -no-compat-check set. Your mission should you choose to accept, is to make a patch that allows FW400 and 800 drives to boot Big Sur correctly. You can start with boot disk media or a full system. It doesn't matter. This task may have multiple winners for booting a Base System / Installer or a Full Big Sur installation. The winners will receive a personalized FREE Big Mac T-shirt, A Flash USB Drive with bigmac2 on it that includes your work (and credit), plus bragging rights for winning the challenge. You have permission to use the v2 branch's postinstall.sh for this mission.

## Bug Mac Hackathon Challenge #3 - Bluetooth 2 support
On a Mac Pro 3,1 it is not possible to boot with Bluetooth 2 enabled. Your mission should you choose to accept, is to stop the stock Bluetooth 2 card in an Early 2008 Mac Pro from crashing without having to disable the card. The second part of this mission is to get the card fully functional like it does in Mojave, Catalina and older macOS'. This task may have multiple winners for compleiting the first and/or second parts of this mission. The winners will receive a personalized FREE Big Mac T-shirt, A Flash USB Drive with bigmac2 on it that includes your work (and credit), plus bragging rights for winning the challenge. You have permission to use the v2 branch's postinstall.sh for this mission.

## Workarounds & What Not

<b>News for BT2 Users:</b> If you have the original Bluetooth2 card, you will need to remove it to get Big Sur to boot. This includes the installer and the installation process itself and the full OS. This problem has been identified by our users. The setup is the following: an original Mac Pro 3,1 with a Bluetooth 2.0 card and an original AirPort Extreme (802.11g/n) card. An immediate solution is being worked on to patch the OS.

<b>If you cannot disable SIP</b> [Download El Capitan here](http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41424-20191024-218af9ec-cf50-4516-9011-228c78eda3d2/InstallMacOSX.dmg) and use its recovery disk. After installing its .pkg file, run this command: Format a disk using MacOS Extended (Journaled) aka JHFS+. Run this in terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app --volume /Volumes/Untitled` Option boot-key boot El Cap. Open Terminal and run `csrutil disable`
  
<b>USB 2.0 Workaround for Input Devices</b>: There is a flaw in Big Sur and Mac Pros with USB 2.0 keyboards, mice and trackpads. These input devices do not reconnect if disconnected. A solution is to use a USB 2.0 Hub connected to a USB 2.0 port. [I have confirmed that this works.](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/17/apple-has-fixed-the-usb-20-connection-bug-in-catalina-but-not-in-big-sur-yet) USB 3.0 PCIe cards will also work, but not at boot time.

### Requirements 
1. Mac Pro 2008 - 2012
1. SIP, a.k.a. System Integrity Protection, must be disabled. If it's on booting the installer might panic.
2. Boot screen. If you don't have a boot screen, support will not be provided. I'll leave that adventure up to you.
3. Native APFS Boot support. For a limited time, Dosdude1's APFS ROM Patcher is included in the üòé folder (this will be removed from the repo soon, and will be included as a [download](http://dosdude1.com/apps/APFS%20ROM%20Patcher.zip) option instead).
4. Your GPU must support Metal. I highly recommended this GPU: Radeon RX 580 8 GB on eBay for $299
5. 1 external USB SSD or hard drive. Thumb drives are not supported.
6. For the actual installation, an SSD or hard drive with 60GB or greater. 256GB recommended.

## How to boot a USB (Requires a Video Card with a Mac Boot ROM)
1. Be sure your Mac Pro can boot APFS volumes directly. There is an APFS ROM Patch for Mac Pro 3,1s.
2. Be sure to disable System Integrity Protection as soon as possible (`csrutil disable ; csrutil authenticated-root disable`).
3. Plug a USB 2.0 keyboard and pointing device directly into your Mac Pro's USB 2.0 ports.
4. Plug the bootable installer into your Mac Pro.
5. Press and hold the Option (Alt) ‚å• key immediately after turning on or restarting your Mac.
6. Release the Option key when you see a gray boot screen showing your bootable volumes.
7. Select the volume containing the bootable installer. Then click the up arrow or press Return. 
8. Choose your language, if prompted.
9. Open the Terminal.
10. Execute `cd /Volumes/bigmac; .preinstall.sh`, and quit Terminal.
11. Select Install macOS Big Sur from the Utilities window, then click Continue and follow the onscreen instructions.

Legacy USB 2.0 for keyboard and mouse devices is not working 100%. If you leave them plugged into a USB 2.0 port, they will work. If you disconnect them, they won't reconnect. This is a problem with Big Sur which Apple introduced on their own. A workaround is use a USB3.0 PCIe card but this only works when the system is booted, not from a cold start. USB 3.0 hubs plugged into a USB 2.0 port may also work. A patch may be implemented to take care of this issue.

Note: Option boot using a boot screen requires a keyboard in directly into the machine and not a PCIe card. Bluebooth keyboards do not catch up in time and PCIe cards don't work without an OS. There used to be a a Bluetooth fix in NVRAM for this. If I locate the fix, will update.

## BigMac's Workflow in a Nut Shell ü•ú
1. Workflow -> Download Big Sur -> Create USB Installer
2. Create your unpatched USB installer disk with bigmac on another partiton with `./bigmac.sh`
3. Execute `cd ~/Downloads/bigmac.master`
4. Execute `./bigmac.sh`
5. Reboot -> hold down OPTION key -> macOS Big Sur Installer
6. Workflow -> Boot USB -> Preinstall.sh -> Install -> Postinstall.sh
7. Boot the USB installer, from its Terminal type:
8. Execute `cd /Volumes/bigmac`
9. Execute `./preinstall.sh`
10. Wait for the install is fully completed (hint: it takes 3 stages to complete.)
11. Boot the USB installer, from its Terminal type:
12. Execute`cd /Volumes/bigmac`
13. Execute`./postinstall.sh`

### Pre Install Track, Before you open the Big Sur Installer (Works with All Macs)
1. Boot up the Install macOS Big Sur USB Disk (Don't have it? Execute `sudo ./bigmac.sh`).
2. Execute `cd /Volumes/bigmac`.
7. Execute `./preinstall.sh`.
8. set boot-args to `-no_compat_check -v`.
9. Quit the Terminal. Open the big Sur installer app.
10. Big Sur installs in three stages.

### Post Install Track, Required for Mac Pro 3,1
1. Boot up the Install macOS Big Sur USB Disk (Don't have it? Run `sudo ./bigmac.sh`)
2. Execute `cd /Volumes/bigmac`.
4. Type `./postinstall.sh` and type in the volume name of the install you just did (e.g., `/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD` (This will be improved in a future version); You may have to use `ls -al` in volumes to get the name before hand. (e.g., `./postinstall.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD`)
5. Quit the Terminal and select your startup disk.

### Notes about Big Sur Installs
1. The install process is done in three stages each varying in time.
2. Allow all three stages to fully complete!
3. Mac Pro 3,1 Early 2008 owners will need to stop an infinite loop after the 4th or 5th reboot. Wait until you see a pattern before killing it). Hold option-key to see if you can get to a boot screen between the kernel panics. If all else fails, hold the power button down and then hold down the option-key.
4. the `-v` boot-arg helps monitor the progress.
5. After about 45 - 60 minutes, the installer should be complete.

### Special Notes with Mac Pro Early 2008 and Metal AMD Cards 
1. Big Sur's video drivers are not compatible with the Penryn style CPU.
2. The Post Install script using MousSEE to emulate a couple instructions.
3. This allows AMD Radeon cards that support Metal to be used on a MP3,1.

### Telemetry and Mac Pro Early 2008
1. The telemetry plugin on Big Sur is not compatible with the Penryn style CPU.
2. The post install script installs one that is compatible.

### Mac Pro Early 2008 Installation Notes
1. In between installer tasks, Big Sur's install runs through 3 complete reboot cycles.
2. If you see kernel panics, or fast reboots after the 5th reboot, you will need to kill the cycle by holding the power button down, or if possible hold down the Option-key see if you can get back to your boot screen.
3. Then you can run the post install script from which method you ran the pre install script.
4. The post install script patches your system and allows it to boot up.

### Pre Install Notes
1. The Preinstall script runs in memory. It does not physically touch the installer. If you reboot before running the Big Sur installer app/task, you will need to run the Preinstall script again. 
2. Because the preinstall script runs in memory, do not attempt run the preinstall twice in the same boot session. This will cause major delays when opening the Big Sur install app/task.

### How to turn off System Integrity Protection (this is now built into preinstall.sh)
1. Open Terminal in the booted recovery disk (and possibly external USB Big Sur USB installer disks made with createinstallmedia).
2. Execute `csrutil disable`.
3. Execute `csrutil authenticated-root disable` (can only be done from Big Sur Recovery disks).
4. Use Start up disk (top left to select your installation).

### How to clone your system
* Execute `sudo asr -s /drag/source/here -t /drag/target/here -er -nov`.

### Known issues with USB 2.0
1. Input devices that get disconnected do not reconnect. Workaround, use a USB 2.0/3.0 hub. Plug that into a Mac USB port and plug your input devices into the hub. This has been tested. USB 3.0 PCIe cards will also work but not at boot time.
2. USB storage devices are hotswapped with issue.
3. Certain thumb drives via USB 3.0 PCIe card, some will disconnect on idle. USB Thumb drives tend to not work on USB 2.0 unless seen at boot time.

### Known issues with MAME input devices
* USB 1.1 will be supported in bigmac2.
