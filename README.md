## üçû Fresh! Featuring bigmac.sh BigMac11USB + bigmac üòÉ
### Welcome to üçî Bigmac's ü•§ USB downloader, üçü Installer and ü•û Configurator
1.  `cd ~/Downloads/bigmac.master`
2. `sudo ./bigmac.sh`
3. Features an automated macOS 11 downloader directly from Apple's CDN.
4. If you already have the Install Big Sur app in your /Applications folder, don't worry, the downloader is optional. 
5. Plus a fully automated USB installer maker with the bigmac patcher on one partion and BigMac11USB on the other.
6. Please do not use thumb drives with the Big Sur External USB disk maker. Only use External SSDs or Hard Drives. Thank you!
7. bigmac.sh also puts -v and -no_compat_check in the boot.plist file for you.
8. If you don't have a boot screen, bigmac.sh has additional tips at the end.

### Future Plans
1. GUI for bigmac.

### When running from an macOS Mojave, Catalina or Big Sur
Only clean installs are supported to an erased Mac OS Extended (Journaled) disk aka JHFS+.

### When running the preinstall.sh from an Install macOS Big Sur USB Disk / BigMac11USB
APFS clean and dirty installs are supported. You can even upgrade older versions of Big Sur!

### Prerequisite (Terminal, set sudo nvram boot-args='-no_compat_check')
1. In order to do this inside macOS, SIP must be disabled
2. In Terminal type `csrutil status` to check if SIP is enabled.
3. If System Integrity Protection is not disabled, set your boot-args from a Recovery disk.
4. From a recovery or install disk disable SIP using `csrutil disable`
5. From a Big Sur recovery or Big Sur install disk disable authenticated-root using `csrutil authenticated-root disable`
4. If you cannot set your boot-args, recommend creating a bootable installer Catalina patch disk from http://dosdude1.com/catalina/
5. set your boot arguments to at least `-no_compat_check`
6. recommended boot-args `-no_compat_check amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 -v`
7. to set boot-args from a Recovery or Install disk : `nvram boot-args='-no_compat_check amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 -v'`
8. to set boot-args from a system with SIP disabled: `sudo nvram boot-args='-no_compat_check amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 -v'`
9. how to check your boot-argments `nvram -p | grep boot-args`
10. you should see something like this `boot-args    -no_compat_check amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 -v`

### Requirements 
1. Mac Pro 2008 - 2012
2. You have MacOS 10.15.x Catalina installed already. (Or do these steps on a supported Mac to an external SSD!)
3. MacOS 11.0.1 Big Sur full installer app (RC2 or public release and later)
4. APFS ROM patcher applied. Dosdude1's APFS ROM Patcher is included in the üòé folder. You only need to flash your Mac's firmware once using his tool. You must put your mac into programming mode. Instructions are included with the tool. This requires time and patience. Don't attempt if you are tired. Do not interrupt.
5. Boot screen. I recommend you have a flashed Nvidia or AMD card that supports Metal. Some steps are difficult without one.
6. Your GPU must support Metal. Flashed AMD Cards like the RX 580 8 GB support 4k @ 60 Hz on Big Sur with 4k boot screen! Flashed Nvidia cards with metal will have 4k @ 30 Hz only. If you know how to get 4k@60Hz on NVidia on Big Sur please let us know. If you have 4k on Flashed Nvidia use a 30 Hz port to get a boot screen.
7. 1 - 2 external USB SSDs or hard drives for Recovery or asr disk cloning.
8. A SSD or Hard drive with 60GB or more. 256GB Recommended.

### How to use createinstallmedia (Preferred method)
1. Drag `Install macOS Big Sur.app` to the Desktop
2. Open Terminal
3. `cd ~/Desktop/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources`
4. `sudo ./createinstallmedia -v /Volumes/externalUSB`
5. type password
6. Ready to Start.
7. If you wish to continue type (Y) then press return: `y`
8. Erasing disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%... 100%
9. Copying to disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%... 40%... 50%... 60%... 70%... 80%... 90%... 100%
10. For convience copy the `bigmac.master` folder to a separate thumb drive

### How to boot your createinstallmedia (External USB Install macOS Big Sur)
1. You will need to run preinstall.sh and then the macOS installer from this disk.
2. The preinstall enables the Mac OS installer in memory. The installer is not physically touched.
3. Reboot boot using `option key` 
4. At boot screen select the external USB `Install macOS Big Sur` disk. (It will be yellow if it is on an external drive)
5. Wait for the external media to boot up. You may see black screen for a minute or two before any verbose logs kick in.
6. From there open the Terminal. It's under the Utilities menu.
7. `ls -a` to see where stuff is (great invention)
8. `cd /Volumes/pathToBigMacDisk/`
6. `cd bigmac.master` (Do not omit cd'ing to this folder it uses the working directory name to get its resources.)
10. Omiting `sudo` follow the `Pre Install track in this guide`
11. Quit the Terminal app
12. Within the window of the booted up install media: select the `Big Sur install icon` and click the `continue` button. Select your disk and agree to the license.
13. After the install is complete, boot from the external USB `Install mac OS Big Sir` disk again.
14. Open Terminal 
15. `cd /Volumes/pathToBigMacDisk/`
16. `cd bigmac.master` (Do not omit cd'ing to this folder)
17. Omiting `sudo` follow the `Post Install track in this guide`
18. Select the start up disk

### Pre Install script (Works with All Macs)
1. Erase a disk using GUID Partition and Mac OS Extended (Journaled) aka JHFS+ (this step may be automated)
2. Open Terminal.app in Utilties
3. `ls -a`
4. `cd /Volumes'
5. `cd whereYouHaveBigMac`
6. `cd bigmac.master` (Do not omit cd'ing to this folder it uses the working directory name to get its resources.)
7. `sudo ./preinstall.sh`
8.  set boot-args to `-no_compat_check amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 -v` or  `-no_compat_check -v`
9. open the macOS Big Sur installer.app
10. select your newly erased JHFS+ disk.
11. in order to complete the install, Big Sur 11.0.1 RC2 and later will reboot 3 times

### Notes about Big Sur Installs
1. The install process is done in three stages each varying in time.
2. Allow all three stages to fully complete!
3. Mac Pro 3,1 Early 2008 owners will need to stop an infinite loop after the 4th or 5th reboot. Wait until you see a pattern before killing it). Hold option-key to see if you can get to a boot screen between the kernel panics. If all else fails, hold the power button down and then hold down the option-key.
4. the `-v` boot-arg helps monitor the progress.
5. After about 45 - 60 minutes, the installer should be complete.

### Special Notes with Mac Pro Early 2008 and Metal AMD Cards 
1. Big Sur's video drives are not compatible with the Penryn style CPU
2. The Post Install script using MousSEE to emulate a couple instructions
3. This allows AMD Radean cards that support Metal to be used on a MP3,1

### Telemetry and Mac Pro Early 2008
1. The telemetry plugin on Big Sur is not compatible with the Penryn style CPU
2. The post install script installs one that is compatible

### Mac Pro Early 2008 Installation Notes
1. In between installer tasks, Big Sur's install runs through 3 complete reboot cycles.
2. If you see kernel panics, or fast reboots after the 5th reboot, you will need to kill the cycle by holding the power button down, or if possible hold down the Option-key see if you can get back to your boot screen.
3. Then you can run the post install script from which method you ran the pre install script.
4. The post install script patches your system and allows it to boot up.

### Pre Install Notes
1. The Preinstall script runs in memory. It does not physically touch the installer. If you reboot before running the Big Sur installer app/task, you will need to run the Preinstall script again. 
2. Because the preinstall script runs in memory, do not attempt run the preinstall twice in the same boot session. This will cause major delays when opening the Big Sur install app/task.

### Post Install script (Required for Mac Pro 3,1 Early 2008)
1. Boot back into your other system using the option key.
3. `ls -a`
4. `cd /Volumes'
5. `cd whereYouHaveBigMac`
6. `cd bigmac.master` (Do not omit cd'ing to this folder it uses the working directory name to get its resources.)
7. from Finder, drag your macOS volume to the Terminal's prompt
8. Press Enter.
9. For Resources press Enter.
10. Wait
11. Press q and Enter to reboot.

### How to create an external USB Recovery disk
1. Note: This trick works from Big Sur BaseSystem.dmg's only
2. `diskutil list 'Mac Volume Name'`
3. copy `disk#s#` (let's say it is `disk2s3` for this exercise)
4. `diskutil mount disk2s3`
5. `open /Volumes/Recovery`
6. Arrow down on the weird UUID tagged folder that looks like this '13540289-83B3-3105-8EC7-B05C342DB382' (this id is unique)
7. `sudo asr -s /Drag/BaseSystem.dmg/Here -t /Volumes/externalUSB_name --er --nov`
8. disk must be around 3GB or higher.

### How to turn off System Integrity Protection
1. Open Terminal in the booted recovery disk (and possibly external USB Big Sur USB installer disks made with createinstallmedia)
2. `csrutil disable`
3. `csrutil authenticated-root disable` (can only be done from Big Sur Recovery disks)
4. Use Start up disk (top left to select your installation)

### bigmac install scripts can run from a Recovery or Installer disk
1. Use a second USB drive and put Big Mac on it.
2. Omit the word `sudo`
3. `cd /Volumes`
4. `ls -a`
5. `cd /pathToBigMacDisk`
6. `cd bigmac.master` (Do not omit cd'ing to this folder it uses the working directory name to get its resources.)
7. Follow Pre-Install or Post-Install track.

### How to clone your system
1. `sudo asr -s /drag/source/here -t /drag/target/here -er -nov`

### Known issues with USB 2.0
1. Input devices that get disconnected do not reconnect. Workaround, get a USB 3.0 PCIe card and for everyday device connect them there. For option-key boot screen boot connect back to USB 2.0
2. USB drive connected to USB 2.0 can connect and reconnect.
3. If using certain thumb drives via USB 3.0 PCIe card, some will disconnect on idle. USB Thumb drives tend to not work on USB 2.0 unless seen at boot time.
4. These issues seem to all be with Big Sur and are beyond's bigmac's currently ability to rectify.

### Known issues with MAME input devices
1. Most of these devices have very old controller boards and use USB 1.0
2. These devices will power on in Big Sur but the system will not use them
3. Workaround, if you are using MAME on your Mac, revert back to Mojave or Catalina. Mojave is recommended for SDL MAME users.
5. These issues seem to all be with Big Sur and are beyond's bigmac's currently ability to rectify.
