Big Sur macOS 11 Mac Pro patcher 

#### Support does not come with bigmac. I work on many projects. This is one that I do in my spare time.
#### Issues are to be used for reporting bugs or features.

## How to boot a USB (Requires a Video Card with a Mac Boot ROM)
1. Plug the bootable installer into a Mac that is connected to the internet and compatible with the version of macOS you're installing.
2. Press and hold the Option (Alt) ‚å• key immediately after turning on or restarting your Mac.
3. Release the Option key when you see a gray boot screen showing your bootable volumes.
4. Select the volume containing the bootable installer. Then click the up arrow or press Return. 
5. Choose your language, if prompted.
6. Open the Terminal
7. `cd /Volumes/bigmac; .preinstall.sh`
6. Select Install macOS (or Install OS X) from the Utilities window, then click Continue and follow the onscreen instructions.

## BigMac's Workflow in a Nut Shell ü•ú
1. Workflow -> Download Big Sur -> Create USB Installer
2. Create your unpatched USB installer disk with bigmac on another partiton with `./bigmac.sh`
3. `cd ~/Downloads/bigmac.master`
4. `./bigmac.sh`
5. Reboot -> hold down OPTION key -> macOS Big Sur Installer
6. Workflow -> Boot USB -> Preinstall.sh -> Install -> Postinstall.sh
7. Boot the USB installer, from its Terminal type:
8. `cd /Volumes/bigmac`
9. `./preinstall.sh`
10. Wait for the install is fully completed (hint: it takes 3 stages to complete.)
11. Boot the USB installer, from its Terminal type:
12. `cd /Volumes/bigmac`
13. `./postinstall.sh`

### Requirements 
1. Mac Pro 2008 - 2012 
2. Boot screen. If you don't have a boot screen, support will not be provided. I'll leave that adventure up to you.
3. Native APFS Boot support. Dosdude1's APFS ROM Patcher is included in the üòé folder.
4. Your GPU Must Support Metal. I highly recommended this GPU: Radeon RX 580 8 GB on eBay for $299
5. 1 external USB SSD or hard drive. Thumb drives are not supported.
6. For the actual installation, A SSD or Hard drive with 60GB or more. 256GB Recommended.

### Pre Install Track, Before you open the Big Sur Installer (Works with All Macs)
1. Boot up the Install macOS Big Sur USB Disk (don't have it? run `sudo ./bigmac.sh`)
2. `cd /Volumes/bigmac`
7. `./preinstall.sh`
8. set boot-args to `-no_compat_check -v`
9. Quit the Terminal. Open the big Sur installer app.
10. Big Sur installs in three stages

### Post Install Track, Required for Mac Pro 3,1
1. Boot up the Install macOS Big Sur USB Disk (don't have it? run `sudo ./bigmac.sh)
2. `cd /Volumes/bigmac'
7. `./postinstall.sh`
8. type in the volume name of the install you just did `/Volumes/macosnamehere` (This will be improved in a future version), You may have to use `ls -a` in volumes to get the name before hand.
9. Quit the Terminal. Select your startup disk.

### Notes about Big Sur Installs
1. The install process is done in three stages each varying in time.
2. Allow all three stages to fully complete!
3. Mac Pro 3,1 Early 2008 owners will need to stop an infinite loop after the 4th or 5th reboot. Wait until you see a pattern before killing it). Hold option-key to see if you can get to a boot screen between the kernel panics. If all else fails, hold the power button down and then hold down the option-key.
4. the `-v` boot-arg helps monitor the progress.
5. After about 45 - 60 minutes, the installer should be complete.

### Special Notes with Mac Pro Early 2008 and Metal AMD Cards 
1. Big Sur's video drivers are not compatible with the Penryn style CPU
2. The Post Install script using MousSEE to emulate a couple instructions
3. This allows AMD Radeon cards that support Metal to be used on a MP3,1

### Telemetry and Mac Pro Early 2008
1. The telemetry plugin on Big Sur is not compatible with the Penryn style CPU
2. The post install script installs one that is compatible

### Mac Pro Early 2008 Installation Notes
1. In between installer tasks, Big Sur's install runs through 3 complete reboot cycles.
2. If you see kernel panics, or fast reboots after the 5th reboot, you will need to kill the cycle by holding the power button down, or if possible hold down the Option-key see if you can get back to your boot screen.
3. Then you can run the post install script from which method you ran the pre install script.
4. The post install script patches your system and allows it to boot up.

### Pre Install Notes
1. The Preinstall script runs in memory. It does not physically touch the installer. If you reboot before running the Big Sur installer app/task, you will need to run the Preinstall script again. 
2. Because the preinstall script runs in memory, do not attempt run the preinstall twice in the same boot session. This will cause major delays when opening the Big Sur install app/task.

### How to turn off System Integrity Protection (this is now built into preinstall.sh)
1. Open Terminal in the booted recovery disk (and possibly external USB Big Sur USB installer disks made with createinstallmedia)
2. `csrutil disable`
3. `csrutil authenticated-root disable` (can only be done from Big Sur Recovery disks)
4. Use Start up disk (top left to select your installation)

### How to clone your system
1. `sudo asr -s /drag/source/here -t /drag/target/here -er -nov`

### Known issues with USB 2.0
1. Input devices that get disconnected do not reconnect. Workaround, get a USB 3.0 PCIe card and for everyday device connect them there. For option-key boot screen boot connect back to USB 2.0
2. USB drive connected to USB 2.0 can connect and reconnect.
3. If using certain thumb drives via USB 3.0 PCIe card, some will disconnect on idle. USB Thumb drives tend to not work on USB 2.0 unless seen at boot time.
4. These issues seem to all be with Big Sur and are beyond's bigmac's currently ability to rectify.

### Known issues with MAME input devices
1. Most of these devices have very old controller boards and use USB 1.0
2. These devices will power on in Big Sur but the system will not use them
3. Workaround, if you are using MAME on your Mac, revert back to Mojave or Catalina. Mojave is recommended for SDL MAME users.
5. These issues seem to all be with Big Sur and are beyond's bigmac's currently ability to rectify.

### Future Plans
1. GUI for bigmac.
